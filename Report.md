The stacked plots demonstrate a clear relationship between velocity and position, as higher velocities result in more significant changes in position, indicating a direct correlation.

In the comparison and overlap plots, the XYZ positions and angles for both PSML and PSMR are generally consistent, with any minor differences not easily discernible from the graphs. This suggests that the TrakStar system is highly accurate.

There are areas that could be improved. I primarily tested the code with the T2 dataset, although I did check the format of other datasets to ensure consistency. I believe the code is generalized enough to handle similar data formats.

For data cleaning, I opted to retain only entries with corresponding timestamps in both datasets. While I explored filling in missing data using median values, the "Frame" column proved challenging to handle. Given that the amount of data lost by removing certain entries is negligible compared to the overall dataset, I decided this approach was sufficient.

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) could be expanded by adjusting the variables, but many key relationships are already evident. The dynamic plotting with video could be improved by embedding the plots directly into the video, rather than displaying in separate windows. Additionally, there seems to be a slight lag (1-2 seconds) between the video and data plotting, likely due to either the data cleaning process or the time required for plotting. This could be optimized.

Iâ€™m preparing for the GRE this weekend, so I had to wrap this task up quickly. While there is room for improvement, I believe this demonstrates my ability to work with data, learn new tools like OpenCV, and solve problems efficiently.
